# Gameboy Scribbltests

The Scribbltests are a (currently very limited) collection of self-written test ROMs for testing all sorts of things. For details, do check the individual test folders.

**Note:** The ROMs in this repository are tested on hardware. The exact models they were tested on as well as the test results are provided in the individual README files.

### Credits, Copyright or whatever

The ROMs in this repository are all written by [me](https://github.com/Hacktix) with the addition of "soft breakpoints" added by [Amjad50](https://github.com/Amjad50). Thanks to the [Emulation Development Discord](https://discord.gg/7nuaqZ2) as well as the [gbdev Discord](https://discord.gg/gpBxq85) for helping with debugging and verifying the tests, as well as motivating me to write these in the first place.

If you have any questions or just want to talk about Gameboy stuff, feel free to hit me up on Discord (Optixâ„¢#1337).
